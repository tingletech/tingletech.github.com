                                          recounted the circumstances of his journey, the food, and the differences between cabin
                                          fare and steerage fare, and the "very bad" circumstances of deck passengers. "They won't
                                          give the deck people even a crust that is left." "I think I shall like the country
                                          well." Chandler mentioned that "stonecutters get seven dollars pr day on the custom
                                          house building must try the mines first." Chandler writes that he doesn't know where he
                                          will stop, but is going north first, near the Yuba, by steamboat. This letter contains
                                          notations in pencil on the first page at the top which reads: "Arrival in California."

                                          <b>Abstract:</b> Chandler writes that the rivers are very dry and the work pays about 4 dollars
                                          pr day. The claims are considered very good and when the rains come they "shall be
                                          prepared to work to good advantage." "I mean to take things cool at present if I don't
                                          get rich the first year." "We have lots of good living in the way of Mellons, Tomatoes
                                          the mellons are far superior to any I ever saw in our Atlantic Home, in size and flavor.
                                          I wish I could send you one mellon as large as we have here you would have to ask all
                                          the neighbors in to eat it." Chandler writes that he thinks he has made several hundred
                                          dollars, but it is in the claim and will be due on what he has sold. On the opposite
                                          side of the picture, Chandler writes "you need not think me a Bachelor nor that this

                                          and Robber party" and a lawsuit that resulted in a hung jury. Chandler finds legal
                                          justice difficult, writing that "It is hard to get justice in Cala, except to shoot or
                                          hang the raskals." Chandler also promises Jane that if she would come to California he
                                          would "make some permanent location for the time we stayed as soon as possible."

                                          think." He warns that "it is dangerous for a man to have his wife here, for they often
                                          leave their husbands and join the wicked world in the cities or villages and show off in

                                          states and are generally quite an Ignorant class of beings." Chandler also praises the

                                          <b>Abstract:</b> Chandler writes that he has received Jane's letters from October and November,
                                          which were miscarried to Omega. He also writes that "the Mormons have been moving for
                                          Salt Lake and sell out cheap." He predicts that "Uncle Sam will have a brush with the
                                          Saints soon" and writes that several men are ready to go to Salt Lake to "get a widow
                                          out there as the Mormons have more than their share." Chandler describes the mining
                                          process of sluicing and washing gravel. Chandler also writes about a wedding the
                                          previous week between a 14 year old "little girl" and a 45 year old man. This letter

                                          four days. He recounts the story of a man named Brenan (spelled in the letter Brannan),
                                          who committed suicide by poison on 1858 February 21 in Grass Valley with his wife and
                                          three children. This letter contains notations in pencil on the first page at the top

                                          year, but based on Chandler's references his daughter Liss, it is less than 1860, when
                                          Liss died. Further, it is unlikely that Chandler wrote twice in March of 1857 or 1859,
                                          which leaves 1858. Also, the location of this letter places it within this time frame,
                                          in addition to the Brenan suicide correlation.

                                          Rivers. He describes the Mormons in the area as an "awful looking set of people" who
                                          "look nearly as bad off as the Piute Indians which are our neighbors." He writes about
                                          Mormon women, one of which said "she would marry any poor good looking young man who
                                          would take her to Cala." He also writes about the Piute, who "are a very civil but
                                          numerous tribe" and their agent, Col. Dodge. Chandler writes that the settlers "have had
                                          a convention of people for making a new Territory called Nevada Territory." Chandler
                                          visited the Washoe Tribe of Indians, mentioning that "they committed some depredations
                                          this past winter" but he thinks "the whites are more to blame than the Indians, they use

                                          offers to sell. He writes that "the Southern feeling or Succession people are about
                                          equal to the Union" and that "we had the Succession flag here flying yesterday." "Troops

                                          Indian trouble last year." Chandler hopes that the abolitionists "will all be sent to
                                          the South and put in the front of the battle as they are responsible for all this
                                          trouble." He encourages Jane to tell their friends not to enlist in the cause, adding
                                          that "their chances will be small for getting back in three years." He ends by asking

                                          Summer as well as with most others." He blames the U.S. Government for mining stock
                                          failures, and mentions that he "resigned [his] position in the Lady Bryan mine on
                                          account of the hard times." He encourages Jane to write oftener. This letter contains

                                          that he favors Greeley over Grant. Chandler extols the virtues of California weather and
                                          the seasons as it pertains to health, adding that in the interior of California, "people
                                          do not usually die until thier [sic] time comes." This letter contains notations in
                                          pencil on the first page at the top which reads: "Promising outlook for paying ore at
